# time_add

## Function
A simple script I made while marathon training (running intervals) and trying to add all the interval times to see what total time I spent running.

## How to Use
Run the script and add your times in the format '0:00'. When you are finished, type in 'done' and your total time will display. If you would like to remove the last time you entered (perhaps you accidentally entered it incorrectly), type "remove". If you want to completely start over, type "reset".

## Future Work
Currently, the function only takes minute:second input. I hope to add hour input. Also, the behave tests are incomplete. I need to add more to test the actual adder and finish creating the test for the input.
